## Calculated Rate Statistics

The season cards automatically calculate these advanced metrics:

### Hitting Rates
- **AVG** (Batting Average): H √∑ AB
- **OBP** (On-Base Percentage): (H + BB + HBP) √∑ (AB + BB + HBP + SF)
- **SLG** (Slugging Percentage): Total Bases √∑ AB
- **OPS** (On-Base Plus Slugging): OBP + SLG

### Fielding Rates
- **Fld%** (Fielding Percentage): (PO + A) √∑ TC

### Pitching Rates
- **ERA** (Earned Run Average): (ER √ó 9) √∑ IP
- **WHIP** (Walks + Hits per Inning): (BB_p + H_p) √∑ IP
- **K/BB** (Strikeout-to-Walk Ratio): K_p √∑ BB_p

## Quick Tips

- **Leave fields blank** if they don't apply (e.g., no stolen bases = leave SB blank)
- **Innings Pitched format**: Use decimals (.1 = ‚Öì inning, .2 = ‚Öî inning)
- **Pitching field names**: Note the "_p" suffix to distinguish from hitting stats
- **Rate calculations**: All done automatically by the season card templates
