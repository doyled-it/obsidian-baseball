## Calculated Rate Statistics

The season cards automatically calculate these advanced metrics:

### Standard Hitting Rates
- **AVG** (Batting Average): H ÷ AB
- **OBP** (On-Base Percentage): (H + BB + HBP) ÷ (AB + BB + HBP + SF)
- **SLG** (Slugging Percentage): Total Bases ÷ AB
- **OPS** (On-Base Plus Slugging): OBP + SLG

### Advanced Hitting Metrics
- **BABIP** (Batting Average on Balls in Play): (H - HR) ÷ (AB - K - HR + SF)
- **ISO** (Isolated Power): SLG - AVG (measures extra-base hit ability)
- **XBH%** (Extra Base Hit %): (2B + 3B + HR) ÷ H
- **BB%** (Walk Rate): BB ÷ (AB + BB + HBP + SF)
- **K%** (Strikeout Rate): K ÷ (AB + BB + HBP + SF)
- **Clutch Average**: RISP_H ÷ RISP (batting with runners in scoring position)
- **Contact Quality**: hard_contact ÷ AB (percentage of well-struck balls)

### Fielding Rates
- **Fld%** (Fielding Percentage): (PO + A) ÷ TC
- **Range Factor**: (PO + A) ÷ Games (fielding activity per game)

### Pitching Rates
- **ERA** (Earned Run Average): (ER × 9) ÷ IP
- **WHIP** (Walks + Hits per Inning): (BB_p + H_p) ÷ IP
- **K/BB** (Strikeout-to-Walk Ratio): K_p ÷ BB_p
- **K/9** (Strikeouts per 9 innings): (K_p × 9) ÷ IP
- **BB/9** (Walks per 9 innings): (BB_p × 9) ÷ IP
- **Pitches per Batter**: PC ÷ BF (pitch efficiency)
